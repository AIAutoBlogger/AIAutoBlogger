      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09/02/2025</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how AI Auto Blogger (the "App") collects, uses, and protects information when you install and use the App in your Shopify store. By using the App, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>When you install and use the App, we may collect and access the following types of data from your Shopify store:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Store information:</strong> Store name, domain, and general shop details needed for app functionality and billing.</li>
        <li><strong>Blog content:</strong> Blog ideas, titles, and generated posts that you choose to create through the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Product information (optional):</strong> If you choose to link products to your generated blogs, we may access product titles, descriptions, images, and related data to include in generated content.</li>
        <li><strong>App subscription data:</strong> Information related to your subscription plan, billing, and usage limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical logs:</strong> Metadata about API calls and generation requests (e.g., timestamps, request IDs, response status) to maintain reliable service and troubleshoot errors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not access customer order data, checkout information, or personal customer details.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information collected solely to provide and improve the App's features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blog generation:</strong> Your ideas and optional product data are processed by AI services to generate blog content.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic publishing:</strong> Generated content can be posted directly into your Shopify store's blog if you choose.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO optimization:</strong> Titles, descriptions, and other metadata may be written into Shopify's metafields for search engine optimization.</li>
        <li><strong>Service reliability:</strong> Logs of requests and responses are kept to monitor app performance, diagnose issues, and prevent misuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing & subscriptions:</strong> Store data is used to manage subscription plans and billing through Shopify's billing API.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties for advertising.</p>

      <p>To deliver the App's functionality, certain data may be securely transmitted to trusted third-party service providers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shopify:</strong> As the platform where your store operates, Shopify continues to have access to store and blog content according to their own policies.</li>
        <li><strong>App infrastructure provider:</strong> The App is hosted on a secure development platform that manages storage, syncing, and compliance. Access is limited to what is necessary to operate and maintain the App.</li>
        <li><strong>AI service provider:</strong> Blog ideas, optional product data, and related prompts are sent to an AI service to generate written content. These requests may be logged for performance monitoring, but are not used to build advertising profiles or resold.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not share your information with advertisers or unrelated third parties. All data access is limited to providing the App's core features.</p>

      <h2>3. AI Content and Responsibility</h2>
      <p>The App uses AI services to generate content based on your inputs. While the AI is designed to produce accurate and natural-sounding text, it may occasionally generate unintended, inaccurate, or incomplete results.</p>
      <p>You remain responsible for reviewing all generated content before publishing it in your store.</p>
      <p>The App provides tools for easy editing, but final review is required to ensure accuracy and suitability.</p>
      <p>Because blog content is generated by AI, results may not always be perfect. The AI may occasionally produce unintended, inaccurate, or incomplete text. You remain responsible for reviewing and editing any content before it is published to your store.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
      <p>Generated blog content and product information are stored only as needed to deliver the requested functionality.</p>
      <p>We retain logs of AI generation requests for [X days/months] for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.</p>
      <p>All data is transmitted securely using industry-standard encryption.</p>
      <p>If you uninstall the App, access to your store's data is automatically revoked. Any retained logs are disassociated from your store and purged within [X days].</p>

      <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>As a Shopify merchant, you have full control over your store's data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may uninstall the App at any time, which revokes our access.</li>
        <li>You may request a copy of the data we have processed on your behalf.</li>
        <li>You may request deletion of your store-related data via Shopify's GDPR compliance process (our App integrates with Shopify's mandatory privacy webhooks to ensure compliance).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. GDPR, CCPA, and Data Protection</h2>
      <p>The App is compliant with Shopify's mandatory privacy and data protection requirements, including GDPR and CCPA.</p>
      <p><strong>Customer data requests:</strong> If Shopify forwards a customer's data request, we respond in compliance.</p>
      <p><strong>Data erasure:</strong> If Shopify instructs us to delete store or customer-related data, we promptly comply.</p>
